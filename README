PuppetShow tool for viewing and manipulating Puppet Report data

 * This is pre-alpha quality software.  Use at own risk.

SETUP:

 - install rmagick gem, sqlite3-ruby gem (what else did we miss?)
 - git clone Facter from reductive labs and install it
 - git clone Puppet (0.24.x branch) from reductive labs
 - copy puppetshow/rails/config/puppet_lib.rb.sample to puppetshow/rails/config/puppet_lib.rb and edit the PUPPET_LIB setting to reflect the location of your cloned puppet repo
 - cd into puppetshow/rails
 - rake db:migrate
 - rake db:test:prepare
 - rake spec   (with any luck these should all pass)
 - ruby script/server
 - connect to http://localhost:3000/
 - load report data:
   - untar puppetshow/reports.tgz to puppetshow/reports/
   - time find ../reports -type f -name '*.yaml' | xargs ruby script/runner script/import_yaml_reports.rb    (and go get lunch :-)

----------

Notes to sel(f|ves):

 - read 'go' and set environment variables according to your system
 - you should be able to then run 'sh -x go' and have it exercise the puppet/puppetmasterd tools and generate a single (store) report and a single (inspect) report
 - a (fully pending) spec is in place describing the data available in the Puppet report objects.
